# ES5_Visualizer


This visualizer will run through multiple stages of development:
    1. Implement simple calculation of problems given coordinate vectors of forces, loads, tensions, etc. 
    2. Port calculations to a 2D grid, add implementation of different styled joints and connections. 
    3. Add Dynamics equations to include kinetics and kinematics. 
    4. Port into a 3D grid, allowing users to solve and visualize 3D diagrams. 

The low-level implementation for this program will be written in C/C++, while most of the visualization will be done in       either Python or Matlab.
